ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project is a hands-on demonstration of collecting data from the web and preparing it for machine learning applications. 
The Jupyter Notebook (day18.ipynb) walks through retrieving information from websites, organizing it into structured form, 
and applying basic preprocessing so the data can be used in ML workflows.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights
Written in Python

Covers:
Fetching web pages using requests
Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup
Converting extracted data into structured tables with pandas
Includes simple preprocessing steps useful before feeding data into ML models
Flexible enough to adapt to multiple websites or datasets
